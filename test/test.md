# Test Directory

The `test` directory organizes and stores test files and resources for your application. This includes integration tests, end-to-end tests, test data, and test utilities.

## Common Uses

1. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test how different parts of the application work together.

2. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
   - Test the complete flow of the application from start to finish.

3. **Test Data:**
   - Mock data and fixtures used for testing.

4. **Test Utilities:**
   - Helper functions and utilities to facilitate testing.
